#Lamia-Community

*Latest News:* We are currently pushing for a 1.00 release in September 2018. This will be our first tagged release. Until that release, use at your own risk, this is a rapidly changing project.

Lamia Community is a platform, built using Flask.py, for those looking for an integrated forum, blog, and status update interface without all of the assumptions made by social network platforms.

## What is Lamia Community?

Lamia is...

* A somewhat conventional forum with the unconventional feature of real time posting in threads 
* A real time "status update" system
* A somewhat conventional platform for blogging 
* A flexible and customizable user profile system

... all tied together with some added seasoning.

## Project Goals

* Remain comfortable for those that are familiar with past and present interfaces
* Keep a limited scope - the project will always consist of forum, blogs, and status updates
* Stay pretty - we think Lamia is cute, but maybe that's just us
* Keep it simple - Lamia's code is, generally, not overly complex, we would like to keep it this way
* Avoiding NiH (not invented here) as much as possible - Lamia makes intelligent use of dependencies that are license compatible

## Development Targets

Most of our current tasks are in the issue tracker, but some additional targets are here.

* Develop a full suite of tests. We're rather ashamed of the current lack of coverage. This will be fixed.
* Adding multi lingual support. This was never on the radar while Lamia was just the engine for a fan site. Now that we are working on making it more generalized, language file support is on our wish list.
