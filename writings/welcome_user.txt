Welcome to World of Equestria, User!

Your registration has been received and is presently awaiting staff approval - this usually doesn't take very long, but if you've caught us while we're dreaming the night away it may take a moment or two... apologies in advance, if that is the case!

Please take this time to review our rules here, and perhaps look over some of our Frequently Asked Questions here. Browsing the forum a little bit before you get started with posting would be wise as well.

With that said, thank you for registering - you'll receive one more email when your account is approved and ready for use. We look forward to getting to know you!
